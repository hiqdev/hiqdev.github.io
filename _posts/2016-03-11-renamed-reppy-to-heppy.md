I had to turn rEPPy to hEPPy to register
it to [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/heppy/).
Reppy was already taken.

[hEPPy](/heppy) is EPP client and library in Python.

[EPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Provisioning_Protocol)
is Extensible Provisioning Protocol used for registrar-registry
communication to register and manage domains.

It's gradually approaching usable state.
